				                	We are healthcare SaaS startup created in Paris, France in 2013. Its purpose is the development of simplified tools for healthcare Practitionners worldwide. The first of them, <a href="https://www.nuvenote.com" target="_blank">Nuve Note</a> is a service dedicated to the acquisition, the storage and the reading of medical data (ie <strong>Electronic Medical Record </strong>also known as <a href="https://www.nuvenote.com" target="_blank">Electronic Health Record</a>, <strong>EHR</strong> or <strong>EMR</strong>). 
				                </p>
				                <p>
				                	Nuve’s claim is « Linking Healthcare Players », as the added value of our services lies in our considering the stakes related to telemedicine, home-aging and, generally speaking, the interfacing of diverse medical devices (Internet of Things). We are considering a sector, which has experienced a limited number of innovations over the latest 15 years (economically speaking, technically speaking, etc.).

Another strong disruptive aspect of <a href="https://www.nuvenote.com" target="_blank">Nuve Note</a> is his mobile-oriented aspect (smartphones and tablets (iPad, Samsung Galaxy, etc.)).
